/**
 * Note that, despite implementing logic to return error values, we're not trying
 * to do "white box" integration testing against complicated mocking logic.
 * The intent behind this logic is just to keep the int-tests passing when run
 * against in-memory stubs, or against the real external service.
 * The intent of the of the int-tests themselves (e.g. InvalidPidTes) is to test
 * against the real service and validate that the production logic
 * does actually work with the real external service.
 * An alternate approach to this would be to mark these kind of int-tests as
 * "disabled" when they're run against in-memory stubs.
